LiveJournal Image Reuploader

Small program which reuploads images from LiveJournal to Flickr. 

For example, you have photos uploaded to service which is blocked in your county (e.g. Yandex.Fotki in Ukraine). You just need to specify link to post in LJIR and hit "РАБОТАЙ" button. Wait several minutes and you'll have all the images from post reuploaded to Flickr.

English translation of LJIR is coming soon.

One engine says LJIR is "malicious". Don't believe him. Believe me. I'm honest.
